- This project excercise utilizes mobile phone sensor train and test datasets from www.smartlab.ws
- It merges the two datasets and looks for mean and standard deviations
- The required packages are read.table() and reshape2()
***The Steps are as Follow***
- Datasets from text files are loaded to form dataframes using read.table() function
- features are extracted
- grepl() is used to parse through mean and standard deviations
- data are bound through cbind 
- melt() function is utilized from reshape package to transform the data
- tidy dataset is shared 

The data files are as follow
=========================================

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second.
